## 🚀 Features

- **Decentralized Fundraising**: Create and manage fundraising campaigns on the blockchain
- **MetaMask Integration**: Seamless wallet connection for transactions
- **Smart Contract Security**: All funds are managed through secure smart contracts
- **Transparent Fund Management**: View campaign balances, contributors, and transaction history
- **Democratic Decision Making**: Vote on fund withdrawal requests
- **Multi-contributor Support**: Multiple people can contribute to a single campaign

## 🔧 Technologies

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Sepolia Testnet), Solidity, Hardhat
- **Authentication**: MetaMask wallet connection
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Development Tools**: Hardhat, ethers.js

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask browser extension
- Sepolia testnet ETH (for testing)

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-investment-platform.git
cd blockchain-investment-platform
```

### 2. Smart Contract Deployment

```bash
# Navigate to the blockchain folder
cd blockchain

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file
touch .env
```

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```env
SEPOLIA_RPC=<your_alchemy_sepolia_url>
PRIVATE_KEY=<your_metamask_private_key>  # Include 0x prefix
```

To get your Alchemy Sepolia URL:

1. Create an account at [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)
2. Create a new app and select Ethereum/Sepolia
3. Copy the HTTP API key

```bash
# Compile the smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests locally (no real ETH used)
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to Sepolia testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

After deployment, you'll see a CampaignFactory address in the console. Note this address.
You should see `Campaign.json`, `CampaignFactory.json`, `contract-address.json` being copied to `web/src/utils/abis/`

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the web folder
cd ../web

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

Create or update `src/utils/abis/contract-address.json` if necessary:

```json
{
  "CampaignFactory": "YOUR_COPIED_FACTORY_ADDRESS"
}
```

Ensure the ABI files are in place (if they weren't copied automatically):

```bash
cp ../blockchain/artifacts/contracts/Campaign.sol/Campaign.json src/utils/abis/
cp ../blockchain/artifacts/contracts/Campaign.sol/CampaignFactory.json src/utils/abis/
```

### 4. Start the Application

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## 📝 Usage Guide

### Connecting Your Wallet

1. **Set MetaMask to Sepolia**: Make sure your MetaMask is connected to the Sepolia testnet
2. **Get Sepolia ETH**: Request test ETH from a [Sepolia faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)
3. **Connect Wallet**: Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the top-right corner

### Creating a Campaign

1. Click "Create Campaign" button
2. Set the minimum contribution amount (in ETH)
3. Submit and confirm the transaction in MetaMask
4. Your campaign will appear in the campaigns list once mined

### Contributing to a Campaign

1. Browse available campaigns
2. Click on a campaign to view details
3. Enter contribution amount (must be ≥ minimum contribution)
4. Click "Contribute" and confirm in MetaMask

### Creating a Spending Request (Campaign Managers)

1. Navigate to your campaign
2. Create a new spending request with:
   - Description of the purpose
   - Amount in ETH
   - Recipient address
3. Confirm transaction in MetaMask

### Approving Requests (Contributors)

1. Navigate to a campaign you've contributed to
2. View the "Spending Requests" section
3. Click "Approve" on requests you support
4. Confirm transaction in MetaMask

### Finalizing Requests (Campaign Managers)

1. After receiving sufficient approvals (>50% of contributors)
2. Click "Finalize" on the request
3. Confirm transaction in MetaMask
4. Funds will be transferred to the recipient

## 🔗 Blockchain Integration Details

### Smart Contracts

The platform uses two main contracts:

1. **CampaignFactory**: Creates new campaigns and tracks all deployed campaigns
2. **Campaign**: Handles individual campaign logic including:
   - Contributions
   - Spending requests
   - Approvals
   - Fund transfers

### Wallet Connection

The platform connects to MetaMask or other Ethereum wallets via the Web3 provider API. Key operations:

- **Read Operations**: View campaign details, balances, and request status
- **Write Operations**: Create campaigns, contribute funds, approve requests, finalize transfers

### Transaction Flow

1. User initiates action (create, contribute, approve, etc.)
2. Wallet prompts for transaction confirmation
3. Transaction is sent to the Ethereum network
4. UI updates when transaction is mined

## 🧪 Development Notes

### Sepolia Testnet

All development and testing should be done on the Sepolia testnet to avoid using real ETH.

### Local Development

For local development without blockchain interaction:
- Comment out blockchain calls in `useWallet` hook
- Use mock data for testing UI

### Troubleshooting

- **Transaction Errors**: Ensure you have sufficient Sepolia ETH for gas
- **Contract Interactions**: Check that ABI files match deployed contracts
- **MetaMask Connection**: Reset MetaMask account if experiencing connection issues
